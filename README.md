Travi Framework
===============

This is a php web framework that I've built over the years as I've worked to understand web development better.

# Installation using [Composer] (http://getcomposer.org/)
## Define the dependency
Add the framework to the require block of your project

<pre>"require": {
     "travi/framework": "default"
}</pre>

## Install
`php ../path/to/composer.phar install` will make the framework available for your project

# Example
An example implementation has been built. The repo can be found [here] (https://github.com/travi/example-framework).
